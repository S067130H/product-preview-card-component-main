## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One thing I learned during this projec was how to use the picture and source tags. Instead of writing a script to replace an image, using the picture tag is much easier.

I also learned to pay close attention to my margins and padding when spacing elements. I had a very small amount of padding that was causing my container's height to go a bit beyond what it should. This caused some frustration thinking that I had white space under my image. In reality though, there was just a little too much padding being applied to the content container.

### Continued development

I would like to work more with the picture and source tags in the future. It took some trial and error to figure out exactly how they work, but eventually I got there. 

### Useful resources

- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This resource helped me learn more about how to create responsive images without the use of JavaScript.
- [CSS Strikethrough: Use Text-Decoration and Line-Through in CSS](https://blog.udemy.com/css-strikethrough/) - This simple resource was a refresher on how to apply a strike-through decoration on the price element.
